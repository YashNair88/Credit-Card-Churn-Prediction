# Credit-Card-Churn-Prediction
Credit Card Default Payment in Taiwa

# Dataset

The Credit Card Default Payment dataset in Taiwan is a crucial dataset for credit card issuers and regulators in Taiwan. It contains data on various factors like credit limit, payment history, and demographic information of credit card holders in Taiwan. This dataset is widely used for predicting credit card defaults and analyzing the creditworthiness of individuals.

One of the applications of this dataset is churn prediction. Churn prediction is a technique used to forecast the likelihood of customers leaving the services of a company. In the case of credit card issuers, churn prediction can be used to identify customers who are likely to default on their payments or cancel their credit cards. This information can be used to prevent churn by taking proactive measures to retain customers.

# Churn Prediction

To perform churn prediction on the Credit Card Default Payment dataset in Taiwan, we can use various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. These algorithms can be used to build a predictive model that identifies the factors contributing to churn and predicts the likelihood of a customer churning.

# Preprocessing

We use Robust Scaler for preprocessing which involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a format suitable for predictive modeling. We then use feature selection, where we identify the most important variables that contribute to churn.

#  Machine Learning Model

Once the data is preprocessed and the variables are selected, we can train our machine learning model on the dataset. The model learns to identify patterns in the data and make predictions based on those patterns. The model's accuracy can be assessed using various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

# Conclusion
 
The Credit Card Default Payment dataset in Taiwan is a valuable dataset for predicting credit card defaults and analyzing the creditworthiness of individuals. Churn prediction is one of the applications of this dataset, and machine learning algorithms can be used to build predictive models that identify customers who are likely to churn.
